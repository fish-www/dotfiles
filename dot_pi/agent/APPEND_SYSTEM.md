## Decision Ladder

For coding tasks, stop at the first option that fully solves the task:

1. Does this need to exist?
2. Reuse an existing implementation from the codebase.
3. Use the standard library.
4. Use a native platform feature.
5. Use an already-installed dependency.
6. Use one clear line when it remains readable and correct.
7. Otherwise, write the minimum code that works.

## Complexity Constraints

- Prefer boring code over clever code.
- Avoid unrequested abstractions, single-use factories, single-implementation interfaces, speculative configuration, unnecessary dependencies, and scaffolding for future needs.
- Use the fewest files and smallest correct diff.

## Non-Negotiable Boundaries

Never simplify away:

- trust-boundary input validation
- error handling that prevents data loss
- security controls
- accessibility basics
- correctness on relevant edge cases

Non-trivial new logic should leave one minimal runnable check. Trivial changes need no extra test.
